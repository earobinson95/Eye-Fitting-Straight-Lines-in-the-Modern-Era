Dear Drs. Jones and Liang,

Please find attached a manuscript, “Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era” intended for submission to JCGS. Previously, common methods of fitting trends by eye involved maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit is suitable, then drawing the line through the set of points. This manuscript provides a basis for the use of 'You Draw It', an interactive feature introduced in the New York Times (2015), as a way to measure the patterns we see in data using modern technology. In the manuscript, we conduct an experiment which validates ‘You Draw It’ as a method for graphical testing by comparing results to the less technological method utilized in Mosteller et al. (1981) and extend that study with formal statistical analysis methods. Data collected in this study serves the purpose of a pilot study intended to lay the foundation for future data collection and provides promising results for understanding the perception of regression. In the future, we envision the use of 'You Draw It' with real data in order to facilitate scientific communication. I hope that you find the manuscript acceptable for consideration in JCGS.

Sincerely,
Emily Robinson
