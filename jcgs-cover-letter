Dear Professor xxx,

Please find attached a manuscript, “Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era” intended for submission to JCGS. The manuscript describes an experiment designed to explores the perceptual hierarchy of graphical features, using a modification of the lineup protocol for testing statistical graphics. The experiment evaluates the effect of plot aesthetics (color, shape, bounding ellipses, trend lines, and prediction bands) on identification of target plots in statistical lineups. We demonstrate that bounding ellipses and prediction bands are more successful than other aesthetics at communicating clustering and linear relationships, respectively. I hope that you find the manuscript acceptable for consideration in JCGS.

Sincerely,
Emily Robinson
